<span><h2>Project name</h2> <p>BiLL_Sort</p></span>
<span><h2>Track</h2> <p>Open Innovation</p></span>
<span><h2>Technologies used</h2> <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase , Tailwind, Bootstrap</p></span>

<span><h2>Project description</h2> 
    <p>Often when we go on trips or outings, there is a lot of confusion about who owes whom and how much! Well, worry not, BiLL_Sort will simplify it all. </p>
     <p>One person needs to create a profile by signing up and is designated as the admin. He/she can then create a group containing the members of the trip. Then, each time an expense is made, the admin will make an entry which specifies the amount spent and who paid for it. </p>
    <p>Once the trip ends, the website will present the final tally of who owes whom how much money ! </p>
     
</span>

<span><h2>Challenges we faced</h2>
     <p>The first challenge was creating a database so that we can store the members names and spendings throughout the trip. </p>
     <p>Then, we faced issues while writing codes for responsive design. </p>
